        text: "SMEs form the backbone of the Swiss economy and account for 99.8 percent of all Swiss companies. In Switzerland today, there are 549,400 small and medium-sized enterprises. Studies have shown that 20 percent of these SMEs will be looking for a suitable successor in the next five years. This means that 400,000 jobs will be affected by a change in ownership, which equals around 10 percent of all employees in Switzerland and poses a great responsibility for Swiss SMEs.\_"
