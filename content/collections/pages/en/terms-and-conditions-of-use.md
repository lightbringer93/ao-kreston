        text: 'In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites (hyperlinks) which are outside the area of responsibility of a&o, an obligation to liability would only come into force in the event that the author had knowledge of the content and that it would have been technically possible and reasonable for that author to prevent use in the event of illegal content.'

        text: 'a&o hereby explicitly states that no illegal content was discernible on the linked pages at the time the links were placed. a&o has no influence of any kind on the current and future design, contents or authorship of linked pages. It therefore hereby explicitly dissociates itself from all content of all linked pages that were changed after the links were placed. This statement applies to all links and references placed within the company’s own website as well as to external entries in guest books, discussion forums, link directories, and mailing lists set up by a&o, as well as in all other forms of databases to which external write access to the content is possible. Liability for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages arising from the use or non-use of such presented information lies solely with the provider of the linked page, and not the party that merely links to the respective publication.'
