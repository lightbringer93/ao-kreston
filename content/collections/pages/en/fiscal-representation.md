        text: 'In Switzerland, a business becomes subject to VAT (VATable) if it independently pursues a professional or commercial activity geared towards the sustained generation of income from services, and acts externally under its own name. This also applies to companies domiciled abroad that operate in Switzerland. To meet the tax obligations, it is therefore important to have a VAT representative in Switzerland. If you choose us as your partner, we will help you to comply with the law at all times.'
