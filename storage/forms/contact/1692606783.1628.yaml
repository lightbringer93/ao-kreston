user_message: "Hello, Kreston A&O\r\n\r\nMy name is Sebastian Stoll, and I'm a Danish software engineer based in Baar, Zug.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a more competent to take over accounting, and tax planning/optimization for my company located in Baar.\r\n\r\nI'm not comfortable with my current accountant, as I feel like I want more than just \"accounting\", which is why I'm reaching out to you.\r\n\r\nI want to be in a position where I have a strong collaboration with a partner that allows me to focus on my core business, while everything accounting and tax is on point.\r\n\r\nYou sparked my interest even more with the \"Bitcoin accepted here\" since my company is partly software consultancy and cryptocurrency trading (for own assets, not third party assets or investor funds). Neither me or my company is selling, investing in, or trading NFTs, so there's no VAT implication on my cryptocurrency activities.\r\n\r\nIn general, I'm looking for a partner that can make sure everything tax and accounting wise is on point, so, if you're offering tax services for private individuals, that's also something I'm interested in. I'm not day trading, but I'm doing investments privately as well (proceeds don't account for more than 50 %, and I hold typically for +12 months).\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd prefer to get in touch with your Zug office.\r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to hear from you!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastian Stoll."
