user_message: "Dear madam/sir,\r\n\r\nIn my\_search for expertise on the\_matter below, I\_have been referred to your office by a friend.\r\n\r\nI am an EU citizen (Dutch national) working in the US on a green card for a US company in Berkeley, California. Details on my position and company I work for can be found here:\_https://www.linkedin.com/in/bart-haverkorn-van-rijsewijk-6540b55/\r\n\r\nI am considering moving back to Europe, and looking\_for a way that I can stay employed with said company, while relocating to Switzerland. I would be interested to hear if and how this could be organized in a way that I can stay at the company as a full time employee. I know several friends that have organized this while living and working in the EU for a US company, and understand that in the case of Switzerland there will be differences.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help,\r\n\r\nBart"
