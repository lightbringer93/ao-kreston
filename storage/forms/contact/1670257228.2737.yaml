user_message: "Dear Sirs, \r\n\r\nWe have a question about VAT registration in Switzerland for a foreign digital goods supplier. \r\nOur European company is a distributer of digital goods, providing video game developers and publishers with promotional opportunities. In accordance with concluded licensing agreement with them, we take over the rights to use and sale their product/development on behalf of our company. Basically, our company is promoting, distributing and selling game to the end user on behalf of it is own name (merchant of record model). Our company also accounts and collects VAT in the country of final user residence as per international requirements, because we are the final seller of the goods to end-user.  Customers of digital content – individuals in different countries of the world. In our case we have no marketplace platform where end user can choose and buy different games. Our end user visits the certain game website, play there and buy in-game purchases there. And when he pays for in-game purchase he faces our company only on payment page. We sell games of different game developers and each game has it’s own website where end user play and buy in-game purchases. \r\n\r\nOur company wants to research taxation issues in Switzerland, because we plan to start there our business activity next year.\r\n1)\tAre there specific details for digital goods supplier VAT registration?\r\n2)\tAre there some additional requirements for the foreign company, which wants to sell online video games to end users from Switzerland? \r\n3)\tIs a quarter VAT return period for non-resident foreign company?\r\n4)\tCan foreign company pay VAT from it’s European bank account? Should non-resident VAT payer provide bank guaranty amount?\r\n5)\tSo, we would like to know, if foreign company (with above described business activity) must appoint a tax representative in Switzerland? Or it is voluntary? \r\nIf it is necessary, could Your company provide these services? What will be the price and cooperation details? Please provide us all possible costs which our business activity could cause in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAppreciate your prompt reply.\r\nIrina Cerkasina"
